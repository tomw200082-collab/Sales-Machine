# Sales-Machine — Current State

> Sole authority on build status and open unknowns. Volatile by design.

## Build ladder status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Constitution | CLAUDE.md truth rules, structure, boundaries | **DRAFT LANDED** — awaiting Tom's written approval |
| 1 — Seed verified knowledge | research findings, evidence snapshot, recipes | **LANDED** (this commit) |
| 2 — Truth interviews with Tom | 5 sessions → `user_confirmed` doctrine + account dossiers | **NOT STARTED** — next up: Interview #1 (ICP) |
| 3 — System reconciliation | verify tag semantics, channel-move checks, contacts | not started (follows #2) |
| 4 — Agents (read-only first) | declarations in `agents/` | not started |
| 5 — Automations | only after base verified; outreach behind frozen flag | locked |

## Interview plan (Phase 2)

1. **ICP + segment ranking** — who is a dream client, who is marginal, why.
2. **Top-10 chain dossiers** — incl. U-001/U-002 below.
3. **Pricing & terms decode** — tag semantics (U-003), then system-verify.
4. **Sales process as-is** — how orders really arrive; roles; WhatsApp reality (U-004, U-006).
5. **Competition, positioning, Core Story raw material.**

Each interview → compiled cards → Tom confirms → merged as `user_confirmed`.

## UNRESOLVED (open unknowns — rule 3: never silently filled)

| ID | Question | Route |
|---|---|---|
| U-001 | Isrotel (~₪940K lifetime, ~13 branches) went dark ~2024-09/10 — churn, channel move, or tender loss? | Interview #2 + Green Invoice check |
| U-002 | Mina Tomei: 5 branches went dark the same week (~2026-02) — one story? recoverable? | Interview #2 |
| U-003 | Tag semantics: `10off`, `50-29`, `300ml-23`, `shotef`, `net30`, `pl`/`client_key` metafields | Interview #3 + system verify |
| U-004 | B2B records use placeholder login emails — where do real ordering contacts live? | Interview #4 |
| U-005 | ICP ranking (segments × buyer type) | Interview #1 |
| U-006 | Off-Shopify sales share (Green Invoice direct? distributor?) — required before any churn claim | Interview #4 + GI check |
| U-007 | Annual-value method assumes steady rate; validate per tier | Recipe validation |
| U-008 | "The website" scope — storefront vs. marketing site vs. B2B portal (separate runtime repo either way, per D-003) | Tom decision |
| U-009 | Data quirk: account with 58 orders and ₪0.00 amountSpent — explain before trusting spend fields | Interview #3 / system check |
| U-010 | 4 identity questions from the 2026-08-06 tracker build (MUZA×2, נונומימי/נונו, קפה עם, קלאוד ניין) — merge or keep separate? | Tom, via `knowledge/accounts/customer-notes.yaml` |
